# __HOW BROWSERS WORK__

##### __STEP ONE__(client side)
Web browsers consist of client software that runs on the client computer and displays home page on the web. this can be ultimately seen
when the browsers diplay content to the users computer on the operating system using the http protocol which is mostly common, a hyper text
transfer protocol which is used in the data comunication in the world wide web.
A world wide web is not like a protocol but rather an accommodation of different sources of information established by an url, uniform resource locater
that points out to different addresses and protocols where information is outsourced.

##### __STEP TWO__(server side)
html code and files tell the browser to do something for exapmle display text, graphics or mulitimedia file and links etc now the web browser uses this code 
to diplay or find the files from the server and diplay on your home page or web browsers. the web browser easily interprates the language, html/css/javascript/etc
and retrieves those files from the server either local host or remotely and displays the content in the homepage.
